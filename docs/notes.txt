limits:
=======

Add this line to:
/etc/security/limits.conf

imiell hard nofile 16384


Another way to increase it is to become root, increase the limit, switch back the user, and start the program you want it increased for:
su - root
ulimit -n 16384 # if root uses sh
limit descriptors 16384 # if root uses csh
su - your_user_name
program_to_run


startup
=======
erl +K true +A 32 +P 100000 -s server_master

K - kernel poll
A - asynchronous threads


DESIGN
======
Connect and get tcp socket, registering interest in a particular level and id.
This is stored in a local table.
Each node receives messages from the monitor.
For each socket that matches the criteria, the message is sent to the client.


TESTING
=======
Get metrics for actual use
How many people have browsers open full stop?


TODO
====
sensible logging. - DONE
ability to switch log levels on the fly.
Sort out logging for time taken to set up socket. - use sasl?
Write server with table for mapping pids to rules, which will receive and process messages
can one reference
sort out router client
sort out config'ing
